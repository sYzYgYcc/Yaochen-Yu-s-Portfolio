## 👤 About Me
🔍 Data-Driven | 🚀 Motivated | 🤝 Collaborative
I am Yaochen Yu, an aspiring data analyst and a graduate student at New York University, specializing in Management and Systems. With a passion for transforming data into actionable insights, I have fine-tuned my expertise in SQL, Excel, and database management to drive data-informed decision-making.

My journey in analytics began at the University of Connecticut, where I merged my love for sports with business acumen to earn a BA in Sports Promotion. The world of data beckoned, leading me to impactful experiences like optimizing logistics for FreshDirect and catapulting sales at New York Auto Depot through strategic data analysis.

What sets me apart? It's my ability to look beyond numbers to see the stories they tell and the strategies they can shape. Whether improving operational efficiencies or boosting sales performance, I believe in the power of data to redefine the contours of business success.

I am always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations that sharpen my analytical skills and expand my understanding of the vibrant intersection between data, technology, and management.
